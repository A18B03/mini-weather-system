# mini-weather-system
This project is a Mini Weather System designed to help farmers monitor environmental conditions crucial for plant growth. By measuring the temperature and soil moisture, the system provides real-time data that can be used to make informed decisions regarding irrigation and plant care.
KEY FEATURES:
1.Real time monitoring of temperature and moisture using the temperature and moisture sensor.
2.It is cost effective, these together will cost less and can be afforded by farmers.
3.It can be easily monitored as we have an led bulb which tells whether the soil is dry or moist and for the temperature we can use serial monitor to check the temperature.
4.It is scalable and can be further be expanded using humidity sensor, rain sensor etc.
5.It improves the crop yield as this helps to give an understanding for the farmers about how to water the crops etc.
APPLICATIONS:
1.	Irrigation Management: Farmers can use the system to monitor soil moisture levels to optimize irrigation. When soil moisture is low, the system can alert the farmer to irrigate the crops.
2.	Climate Monitoring: The temperature data helps in monitoring temperature fluctuations, which is important for deciding the best time to plant or harvest crops.
3.	Remote Monitoring: With additional modifications, the system can be expanded to transmit data to a remote server or mobile app, providing farmers with the ability to check weather conditions from anywhere.
4.	Smart Farming: This system lays the groundwork for a more automated farm, where the data from the environment can drive automated decisions (e.g., irrigation systems, greenhouses).
